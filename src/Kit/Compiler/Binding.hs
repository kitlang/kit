{-
  Bindings are used as part of each Module's interface; they map names to type
  definitions, of which none of the types have been resolved yet. This allows
  other modules to look up the type and find a type variable to reference,
  which should eventually resolve to the correct type.

  Types in these bindings will be type variables; expressions are meaningless.
