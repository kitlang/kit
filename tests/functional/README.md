Each Kit file in this directory will be compiled and run automatically as part of Kit.CompilerSpec. The file should contain a main function and must successfully compile.

Compile any of these manually with: `kitc --run tests/functional/helloworld.kit`

TODO: suffix with _fail.kit to expect failure
